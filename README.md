Discrete Goodness-of-Fit Tests

This package contains a proposed revision to the stats::ks.test() function and the associated ks.test.Rd help page. With one minor exception, it does not change the existing behavior of ks.test(), and it adds features necessary for doing one-sample tests with hypothesized discrete distributions. The package also contains cvm.test(), for doing one-sample Cramer-von Mises goodness-of-fit tests.
